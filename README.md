# Kiwi's Paradise eCommerce V2

This is my third re-edition of my eCommerce website that is centered on selling plushies. This website was made by using React.js, CSS, Bootstrap, node, and express.

## Getting Started

Clone or download this repo onto your local machine. Once you have done this, install the node packages. You can do this by running ```npm i``` on your command line tool.


## Running the app

After you have installed all of the dependencies that are needed for this project, you can open the project up through your command line tool. First be in the root of the directory and then run ```npm run start``` in your command line tool. This will start the server and the react app at the same time.


## Stopping the app

To stop running the server and the react app, you can hit ```command + z``` to close both.
